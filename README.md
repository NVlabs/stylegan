> **A Style-Based Generator Architecture for Generative Adversarial Networks**<br>
> Tero Karras (NVIDIA), Samuli Laine (NVIDIA), Timo Aila (NVIDIA)<br>
> https://arxiv.org/abs/1812.04948

> **Abstract:** *We propose an alternative generator architecture for generative adversarial networks, borrowing from style transfer literature. The new architecture leads to an automatically learned, unsupervised separation of high-level attributes (e.g., pose and identity when trained on human faces) and stochastic variation in the generated images (e.g., freckles, hair), and it enables intuitive, scale-specific control of the synthesis. The new generator improves the state-of-the-art in terms of traditional distribution quality metrics, leads to demonstrably better interpolation properties, and also better disentangles the latent factors of variation. To quantify interpolation quality and disentanglement, we propose two new, automated methods that are applicable to any generator architecture. Finally, we introduce a new, highly varied and high-quality dataset of human faces.*

## Using pre-trained networks

A minimal example of using a pre-trained StyleGAN generator is given in [pretrained_example.py](./pretrained_example.py). When executed, the script downloads a pre-trained StyleGAN generator from Google Drive and uses it to generate an image:

```

A more advanced example is given in [generate_figures.py](./generate_figures.py). The script reproduces the figures from our paper in order to illustrate style mixing, noise inputs, and truncation:
```

```

The pre-trained networks are stored as standard pickle files on Google Drive:

```
# Load pre-trained network.
url = 'https://drive.google.com/uc?id=1MEGjdvVpUsu1jB4zrXZN7Y4kBBOzizDQ' # karras2019stylegan-ffhq-1024x1024.pkl
with dnnlib.util.open_url(url, cache_dir=config.cache_dir) as f:
    _G, _D, Gs = pickle.load(f)
    # _G = Instantaneous snapshot of the generator. Mainly useful for resuming a previous training run.
    # _D = Instantaneous snapshot of the discriminator. Mainly useful for resuming a previous training run.
    # Gs = Long-term average of the generator. Yields higher-quality results than the instantaneous snapshot.
```

The above code downloads the file and unpickles it to yield 3 instances of [dnnlib.tflib.Network](./dnnlib/tflib/network.py). To generate images, you will typically want to use `Gs` &ndash; the other two networks are provided for completeness. In order for `pickle.load()` to work, you will need to have the `dnnlib` source directory in your PYTHONPATH and a `tf.Session` set as default. The session can initialized by calling `dnnlib.tflib.init_tf()`.

There are three ways to use the pre-trained generator:

1. Use `Gs.run()` for immediate-mode operation where the inputs and outputs are numpy arrays:
   ```
   # Pick latent vector.
   rnd = np.random.RandomState(5)
   latents = rnd.randn(1, Gs.input_shape[1])

   # Generate image.
   fmt = dict(func=tflib.convert_images_to_uint8, nchw_to_nhwc=True)
   images = Gs.run(latents, None, truncation_psi=0.7, randomize_noise=True, output_transform=fmt)
   ```
   The first argument is a batch of latent vectors of shape `[num, 512]`. The second argument is reserved for class labels (not used by StyleGAN). The remaining keyword arguments are optional and can be used to further modify the operation (see below). The output is a batch of images, whose format is dictated by the `output_transform` argument.

2. Use `Gs.get_output_for()` to incorporate the generator as a part of a larger TensorFlow expression:
   ```
   latents = tf.random_normal([self.minibatch_per_gpu] + Gs_clone.input_shape[1:])
   images = Gs_clone.get_output_for(latents, None, is_validation=True, randomize_noise=True)
   images = tflib.convert_images_to_uint8(images)
   result_expr.append(inception_clone.get_output_for(images))
   ```
   The above code is from [metrics/frechet_inception_distance.py](./metrics/frechet_inception_distance.py). It generates a batch of random images and feeds them directly to the [Inception-v3](https://arxiv.org/abs/1512.00567) network without having to convert the data to numpy arrays in between.

3. Look up `Gs.components.mapping` and `Gs.components.synthesis` to access individual sub-networks of the generator. Similar to `Gs`, the sub-networks are represented as independent instances of [dnnlib.tflib.Network](./dnnlib/tflib/network.py):
   ```
   src_latents = np.stack(np.random.RandomState(seed).randn(Gs.input_shape[1]) for seed in src_seeds)
   src_dlatents = Gs.components.mapping.run(src_latents, None) # [seed, layer, component]
   src_images = Gs.components.synthesis.run(src_dlatents, randomize_noise=False, **synthesis_kwargs)
   ```
   The above code is from [generate_figures.py](./generate_figures.py). It first transforms a batch of latent vectors into the intermediate *W* space using the mapping network and then turns these vectors into a batch of images using the synthesis network. The `dlatents` array stores a separate copy of the same *w* vector for each layer of the synthesis network to facilitate style mixing.

The exact details of the generator are defined in [training/networks_stylegan.py](./training/networks_stylegan.py) (see `G_style`, `G_mapping`, and `G_synthesis`). The following keyword arguments can be specified to modify the behavior when calling `run()` and `get_output_for()`:

* `truncation_psi` and `truncation_cutoff` control the truncation trick that that is performed by default when using `Gs` (&psi;=0.7, cutoff=8). It can be disabled by setting `truncation_psi=1` or `is_validation=True`, and the image quality can be further improved at the cost of variation by setting e.g. `truncation_psi=0.5`. Note that truncation is always disabled when using the sub-networks directly. The average *w* needed to manually perform the truncation trick can be looked up using `Gs.get_var('dlatent_avg')`.

* `randomize_noise` determines whether to use re-randomize the noise inputs for each generated image (`True`, default) or whether to use specific noise values for the entire minibatch (`False`). The specific values can be accessed via the `tf.Variable` instances that are found using `[var for name, var in Gs.components.synthesis.vars.items() if name.startswith('noise')]`.

* When using the mapping network directly, you can specify `dlatent_broadcast=None` to disable the automatic duplication of `dlatents` over the layers of the synthesis network.

* Runtime performance can be fine-tuned via `structure='fixed'` and `dtype='float16'`. The former disables support for progressive growing, which is not needed for a fully-trained generator, and the latter performs all computation using half-precision floating point arithmetic.

## Preparing datasets for training

The training and evaluation scripts operate on datasets stored as multi-resolution TFRecords. Each dataset is represented by a directory containing the same image data in several resolutions to enable efficient streaming. There is a separate *.tfrecords file for each resolution, and if the dataset contains labels, they are stored in a separate file as well. By default, the scripts expect to find the datasets at `datasets/<NAME>/<NAME>-<RESOLUTION>.tfrecords`. The directory can be changed by editing [config.py](./config.py):

```
result_dir = 'results'
data_dir = 'datasets'
cache_dir = 'cache'
```

To obtain the FFHQ dataset (`datasets/ffhq`), please refer to the [Flickr-Faces-HQ repository](https://github.com/NVlabs/ffhq-dataset).

To obtain the CelebA-HQ dataset (`datasets/celebahq`), please refer to the [Progressive GAN repository](https://github.com/tkarras/progressive_growing_of_gans).

To obtain other datasets, including LSUN, please consult their corresponding project pages. The datasets can be converted to multi-resolution TFRecords using the provided [dataset_tool.py](./dataset_tool.py):

```
> python dataset_tool.py create_lsun datasets/lsun-bedroom-full ~/lsun/bedroom_lmdb --resolution 256
> python dataset_tool.py create_lsun_wide datasets/lsun-car-512x384 ~/lsun/car_lmdb --width 512 --height 384
> python dataset_tool.py create_lsun datasets/lsun-cat-full ~/lsun/cat_lmdb --resolution 256
> python dataset_tool.py create_cifar10 datasets/cifar10 ~/cifar10
> python dataset_tool.py create_from_images datasets/custom-dataset ~/custom-images
```
## Resizing images to be of uniform size
The stylegan model requires all images in the dataset to be of uniform size , when using a custom dataset this may cause a frequent error because all the images in the dataset may not be of the same shape. To resize all images in your dataset to be of uniform shape execute the below command in your terminal or console. The arguments needed to be passed are , image_dataset_directory ,  image save directory  , image_size. The image size should be a single integer such as 128,256,512 and in addition the number of channels are by default set to 3.

```
> python preprocess_image.py image_dataset_directory/  resized_image_save_directory/ 256
```
## Training networks

Once the datasets are set up, you can train your own StyleGAN networks as follows:

1. Edit [train.py](./train.py) to specify the dataset and training configuration by uncommenting or editing specific lines.
2. Run the training script with `python train.py`.
3. The results are written to a newly created directory `results/<ID>-<DESCRIPTION>`.
4. The training may take several days (or weeks) to complete, depending on the configuration.

By default, `train.py` is configured to train the highest-quality StyleGAN (configuration F in Table 1) for the FFHQ dataset at 1024&times;1024 resolution using 8 GPUs. Please note that we have used 8 GPUs in all of our experiments. Training with fewer GPUs may not produce identical results &ndash; if you wish to compare against our technique, we strongly recommend using the same number of GPUs.

Expected training times for the default configuration using Tesla V100 GPUs:

| GPUs | 1024&times;1024  | 512&times;512    | 256&times;256    |
| :--- | :--------------  | :------------    | :------------    |
| 1    | 41 days 4 hours  | 24 days 21 hours | 14 days 22 hours |
| 2    | 21 days 22 hours | 13 days 7 hours  | 9 days 5 hours   |
| 4    | 11 days 8 hours  | 7 days 0 hours   | 4 days 21 hours  |
| 8    | 6 days 14 hours  | 4 days 10 hours  | 3 days 8 hours   |

## Evaluating quality and disentanglement

The quality and disentanglement metrics used in our paper can be evaluated using [run_metrics.py](./run_metrics.py). By default, the script will evaluate the Fr&eacute;chet Inception Distance (`fid50k`) for the pre-trained FFHQ generator and write the results into a newly created directory under `results`. The exact behavior can be changed by uncommenting or editing specific lines in [run_metrics.py](./run_metrics.py).

Expected evaluation time and results for the pre-trained FFHQ generator using one Tesla V100 GPU:

| Metric    | Time      | Result   | Description
| :-----    | :---      | :-----   | :----------
| fid50k    | 16 min    | 4.4159   | Fr&eacute;chet Inception Distance using 50,000 images.
| ppl_zfull | 55 min    | 664.8854 | Perceptual Path Length for full paths in *Z*.
| ppl_wfull | 55 min    | 233.3059 | Perceptual Path Length for full paths in *W*.
| ppl_zend  | 55 min    | 666.1057 | Perceptual Path Length for path endpoints in *Z*.
| ppl_wend  | 55 min    | 197.2266 | Perceptual Path Length for path endpoints in *W*.
| ls        | 10 hours  | z: 165.0106<br>w: 3.7447 | Linear Separability in *Z* and *W*.

Please note that the exact results may vary from run to run due to the non-deterministic nature of TensorFlow.
